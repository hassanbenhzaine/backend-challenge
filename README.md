# BACKEND ENGINEERING TASK

**ESTIMATED TIME**: 240 MINUTES (you are allowed to take more time)

Your task today is to create a simple REST application from scratch. To reduce implementation time, please use the NestJS framework (this is a MUST, donâ€™t use any other framework). The application should implement a nodeJS server API communicating with this: https://reqres.in/

**IMPORTANT**: Please cover every path of code with tests (unit AND functional tests)! 


Please use the following prerequisites below:

- use TypeScript 3.4 and above. 

- use NestJS Framework, https://docs.nestjs.com/ 

- use MongoDB 4.4 and above 

- use RabbitMQ 3.7 and above




Your REST app should consist of:



#### 1. POST /api/users

On the request store the user entry in db. After the creation, send an email and rabbit event. Both can be dummy sending (no consumer needed).

#### 2. GET /api/user/{userId}

Retrieves data from https://reqres.in/api/users/{userId} and returns a user in JSON representation.

#### 3. GET /api/user/{userId}/avatar

Retrieves image by 'avatar' URL.

On the first request it should save the image as a plain file, stored as a mongodb entry with userId and hash. Return its base64-encoded representation.

On following requests should return the previously saved file in base64-encoded. representation (retrieve from db).

#### 4. DELETE /api/user/{userId}/avatar

Removes the file from the FileSystem storage.

Removes the stored entry from db.


The main goal of the task is to show your skills in the best way possible.


#### Done?

- [x] Your project passes eslint
- [x] The project builds and can start
- [x] All endpoints can be requested from postman
- [x] Data is stored in database successfully and rabbit event is emitted
- [x] Your application is covered with unit/functional test (IMPORTANT!)


#### How to run project?

1. Run command "npm install"
2. Modify the .env file with appropriate MONGODB_URI
3. Run command "npm run start"
4. Access the API from http://localhost:3000
